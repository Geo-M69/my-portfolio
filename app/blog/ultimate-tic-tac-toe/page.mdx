## The Prototype

For this assignment, I designed **Ultimate Tic Tac Toe**, a browser-based strategy game that expands the familiar 3×3 Tic Tac Toe structure into a layered strategic system. The prototype is fully playable online, allowing rapid iteration and live playtesting.

The game features a 3×3 grid of smaller 3×3 boards. Players attempt to win individual mini-boards by completing three in a row. Victory on the global board occurs when a player wins three mini-boards in a row. The defining mechanic is the **redirection rule**: the square a player selects within a mini-board determines which mini-board the opponent must play in next.

This mechanic creates two levels of strategic thinking:

- **Local level:** Securing or blocking wins within a mini-board.
- **Global level:** Controlling which board the opponent must play in next.

The design goal was to explore depth through structure alone, rather than introducing new resources or abilities. Each move carries meaningful trade-offs between offense and defense, and successful players must anticipate multiple turns ahead.

To maintain clarity, the prototype highlights the active mini-board and disables interaction on inactive boards. This ensures that strategic depth emerges from gameplay decisions, not confusion.

## The Context

The assignment prompt asked for a game that introduces an innovative mechanic or twist on an existing system, refined through playtesting. The focus was on intentional design decisions under constraints, not visual polish.

I served as both designer and developer, responsible for:

- Defining rules and interaction logic
- Implementing the digital prototype
- Designing the interface
- Facilitating and documenting playtests

Key constraints included:

- **Clarity:** The redirection mechanic is unintuitive for new players.
- **Time:** The prototype had to be mechanically complete within a short development cycle.

To address these, I prioritized:

- Mechanical functionality
- Clear visual feedback
- Playable stability

I intentionally avoided aesthetic polish to focus on interaction clarity, because confusing rules would undermine the strategic system. Solutions included concise instructions, active board highlighting, and disabling inactive boards.

## Brainstorming

Brainstorming focused on ways to introduce meaningful variation into familiar games. I generated fewer than ten initial concepts, including:

- A social-deduction card game inspired by Uno
- Simulations based on repair mechanics
- Multi-layered variations of Tic Tac Toe

Generating ideas was straightforward; the challenge lay in evaluating feasibility under constraints. Several concepts were eliminated due to complex balancing requirements or hidden information systems that would have been difficult to prototype and refine in the short timeframe.

The **Ultimate Tic Tac Toe** idea stood out because it offered strategic depth through a single rule modification, allowing meaningful iteration and clear observation of player behavior.

## Choosing an Idea

The team selected Ultimate Tic Tac Toe for its balance between strategic depth and implementation feasibility.

Other concepts, like the social-deduction card game, promised dynamic interactions but required multiple systems, hidden information, and extensive playtesting to refine. In contrast, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe created depth through spatial constraint rather than additional mechanics, ensuring development time could be spent improving clarity and observing player strategy.

Prioritization criteria included:

- Mechanical clarity
- Depth per rule
- Feasible iteration within the timeframe

This structured approach allowed us to select an idea that was both innovative and actionable.

## Playtests

Playtesting revealed a gap between designer assumptions and player interpretation. The primary observation was that new players initially ignored the redirection rule, attempting to play anywhere on the board. This highlighted the importance of strong visual cues and instruction.

Once players understood the rule (usually after two to three moves), behavior shifted dramatically:

- Players began strategically sending opponents to disadvantaged boards
- Decision-making became deeper, as each move impacted both local and global boards
- Cognitive load increased, occasionally slowing game pacing

These observations confirmed that the mechanic successfully encouraged strategic foresight, while also emphasizing the need for clear guidance and manageable pacing.

---

## Iterating

Based on playtesting, the most meaningful iteration would address pacing under high cognitive load.

I would implement a structured turn timer with adaptive flexibility:

- **Countdown timer:** 20-30 seconds per turn
- **Adaptive extension:** Brief additional time when players are sent to newly unlocked or complex boards
- **Default action:** If time expires, a valid move is automatically selected to maintain flow

This change preserves strategic depth while reducing analysis paralysis, allowing the game to remain engaging without sacrificing the two-tiered decision-making that defines it.
